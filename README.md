# Bissbotch

## About Me
My name is bissbotch and I'm a 21 year old cyber security student at university and part-time freelance web developer. Most code will be work from university but will include some personal projects as well.

## Collaborate
If you see something I am working on that you think is potentially interesting and you'd like to help out, message me on twitter or Discord.

## Projects
Currently the main projects I will be working on now will be pen testing tools, usually basic and none likely to be used by anyone but just to help me build my skills in various languages.
